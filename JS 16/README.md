Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Download the product.html, product.js, and products.xml files to a directory on your computer.

Open the product.html file in a web browser.

Enter a search query into the search box and click the Search button.

If any products match the search query, they will be displayed in a table below the search box. If no products match the search query, the table will be empty.

To search for a different product, enter a new search query and click the Search button again.

Program Details
The product.html file contains the HTML code for the web page, including the search box and table. The product.js file contains the JavaScript code that handles the parsing of the XML data and the display of the product information in the table. The products.xml file contains the data about the products, including their names, prices, quantities, and descriptions.

The program uses the DOMParser() object to parse the XML data and convert it into a Document object. It then loops through the products and uses JavaScript to access their properties (product name, price, quantity, etc.). The program creates a table and uses JavaScript to add rows to the table, displaying the product information.

The program also includes a function that takes the name of a product and returns the information of that product. This function is called when the user enters a search query and clicks the Search button. The program filters the products based on the search query and then displays the matching products in the table.
